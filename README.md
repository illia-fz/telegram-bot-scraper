# telegram-bot-scraper

Tool to automatically parse new Telegram bot listings and track their releases.

## Features

- Fetches the latest Telegram bot listings from an aggregator website (e.g. Botostore).
- Extracts bot names and links and prints them to stdout.
- Easily extensible to parse additional pages or output formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for Python package dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).

## Setup

Itâ€™s recommended to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the scraper script from your terminal:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

It will fetch the latest bots and print each bot name along with a link to the bot details page.

## Configuration

By default the script scrapes `https://botostore.com/new/`. You can pass a different URL as an argument to the `fetch_new_bots` function in `scraper.py`.
